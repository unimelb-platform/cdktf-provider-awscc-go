type EcsServicePlacementStrategies struct {
	// The field to apply the placement strategy against.
	//
	// For the ``spread`` placement strategy, valid values are ``instanceId`` (or ``host``, which has the same effect), or any platform or custom attribute that's applied to a container instance, such as ``attribute:ecs.availability-zone``. For the ``binpack`` placement strategy, valid values are ``cpu`` and ``memory``. For the ``random`` placement strategy, this field is not used.

	// The type of placement strategy.
	//
	// The ``random`` placement strategy randomly places tasks on available candidates. The ``spread`` placement strategy spreads placement across available candidates evenly based on the ``field`` parameter. The ``binpack`` strategy places tasks on available candidates that have the least available amount of the resource that's specified with the ``field`` parameter. For example, if you binpack on memory, a task is placed on the instance with the least amount of remaining memory but still enough to run the task.
