	//
	// This field is related to the ``EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli`` field. If one or both of these fields is ``true``*and* the viewer request includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header, then CloudFront does the following:
	//   +  Normalizes the value of the viewer's ``Accept-Encoding`` header
	//   +  Includes the normalized header in the cache key
	//   +  Includes the normalized header in the request to the origin, if a request is necessary
	//
	//  For more information, see [Compression support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-policy-compressed-objects) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
	//  If you set this value to ``true``, and this cache behavior also has an origin request policy attached, do not include the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in the origin request policy. CloudFront always includes the ``Accept-Encoding`` header in origin requests when the value of this field is ``true``, so including this header in an origin request policy has no effect.
	//  If both of these fields are ``false``, then CloudFront treats the ``Accept-Encoding`` header the same as any other HTTP header in the viewer request. By default, it's not included in the cache key and it's not included in origin requests. In this case, you can manually add ``Accept-Encoding`` to the headers whitelist like any other HTTP header.
