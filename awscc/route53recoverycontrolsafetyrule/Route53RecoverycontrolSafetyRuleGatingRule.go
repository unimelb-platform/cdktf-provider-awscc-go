	// Routing controls that can only be set or unset if the specified RuleConfig evaluates to true for the specified GatingControls.
	//
	// For example, say you have three gating controls, one for each of three AWS Regions. Now you specify AtLeast 2 as your RuleConfig. With these settings, you can only change (set or unset) the routing controls that you have specified as TargetControls if that rule evaluates to true.
	// In other words, your ability to change the routing controls that you have specified as TargetControls is gated by the rule that you set for the routing controls in GatingControls.

	TargetControls *[]*string `field:"required" json:"targetControls" yaml:"targetControls"`
	// An evaluation period, in milliseconds (ms), during which any request against the target routing controls will fail.
	//
	// This helps prevent "flapping" of state. The wait period is 5000 ms by default, but you can choose a custom value.
