	// The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points.
	//
	// For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call that includes a ``StorageResolution`` of 1 second.
	//  If the ``StartTime`` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:
	//   +  Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).
	//   +  Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).
	//   +  Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).
