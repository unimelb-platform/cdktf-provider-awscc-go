# Generated Go CDKTF Provider for hashicorp/awscc

A pregenerated provider for hashicorp/awscc as it is not pregenerated by the cdktf project yet, likely owing to the "technical preview" release status of the provider.

## Usage

Run the following to pull the library into your cdktf go project, replacing `<version>` to match the desired version.

```
go get github.com/cdktf/cdktf-provider-aws-go/aws/<version>
```

## Versioning

This repository deliberately follows its own versioning, and does not follow the convention of the official cdktf pre-generated providers.

Once the provider reaches a more stable release status it is likely that the cdktf project will begin pre-generating the provider (since it is an official hashicorp provider) and the significantly differing version numbers should help alleviate any confusion during the changeover period.

When updating, using conventional commits nomenclature to bump the correct version component (major/minor/patch).

### Examples

See [terraform's versioning docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/version-constraints) for format information.
